# Project 3

## Objectives

- Practice good documentation for a growing infrastructure
- Play with creating a CloudFormation

## TODO List:

1. Create a CloudFormation Template that can recreate your environment installation - from the VPC to the two systems we have created so far.

- [Simplified Example Config File](sample-config-file.yml)
- [Example Configuration File](https://github.com/mkijowski/aws-cf-templates/blob/master/course-templates/ceg3400.yml)
- Scope: "configurations" will include software that needs to be installed on the system. Do not deal with configuration files.
- Note: to keep costs down, you will need to delete your Cloud Stack in between build & test
