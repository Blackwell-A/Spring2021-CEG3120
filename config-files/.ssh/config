# Simple example, ssh command would look like:
# ssh ubuntu@3.214.193.69
Host 3.214.193.69
        # path to your private key file
        IdentityFile ~/ceg3120-key.pem
# Fancy example, ssh command would look like:
# ssh ceg3120
Host ceg3120
        # ip address of system
        HostName 3.214.193.69
        # username you want to log in as
        User ubuntu
        # path to your private key file
